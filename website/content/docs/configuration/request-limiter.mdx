page_title: Request Limiter - Configuration
description: |-
  The Request Limiter mitigates overload scenarios in Vault by adaptively
  limiting in-flight requests based on latency measurements.
---

# `request_limiter`

The `request_limiter` stanza allows operators to turn off the adaptive
concurrency limiter, which is on by default. This is a reloadable config.

```hcl
request_limiter {
  disable = true
}
```

~> **Warning** Turning off the Request Limiter while Vault is experiencing high
levels of traffic could result in immediate overload of the server. Great care
should be taken when using this configuration to avoid adverse affects in
optimal request servicing. It is strongly advised NOT to use this configuration
unless there is a very good reason.
