### Default Lease Count Quota enabled when upgrading from Vault versions before 1.9

#### Affected versions

- 1.16.0+

#### Issue

Default Lease Count Quotas are enabled for new clusters by consulting Vault's
past versions.

However, the version store was introduced in 1.9. As a result, upgrading from a
version prior to 1.9 enables the Default Lease Count Quota.

You can query the quota via the `/sys/quotas/lease-count/default` endpoint, and
modify or delete it as appropriate:

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/quotas/lease-count/default
$ vault delete sys/quotas/lease-count/default
$ vault write sys/quotas/lease-count/default max_leases=<# of max leases>
```

Refer to [Protecting Vault with Resource
Quotas](/vault/tutorials/operations/resource-quotas) for a step-by-step tutorial
on proper quota tuning.
