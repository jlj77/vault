description: |-
  The Request Limiter mitigates overload scenarios in Vault by adaptively
  limiting in-flight requests based on latency measurements.

# `request_limiter`

The `request_limiter` stanza allows operators to turn on the adaptive
concurrency limiter, which is off by default. This is a reloadable config.

```hcl
request_limiter {
  disable = false
}
```

~> **Warning** This feature is still in Tech Preview. Turning the Request
Limiter *on* may have negative effects on request success rates. Please test
your workloads before turning this on in production.

~> **Warning** Turning the Request Limiter *off* while Vault is experiencing
high levels of traffic could result in immediate overload of the server. Great
care should be taken when using this configuration to avoid adverse effects in
optimal request servicing. It is strongly advised NOT to use this configuration
unless there is a very good reason.
